# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to help understand the demographics of Pewlett-Hackard employees who are near retirement.  Specifically, we were asked to provide a breakdown of how many individuals are in the retirement zone (born between 1952 and 1955) by their current job titles.  This required combining information from two separate csv files, filtering by birth date range and since many individuals held several titles over the course of their career, we needed to list these individuals by their most recent job title.  In response to the large number of near term retirees, a second aspect of the analysis involved the identification of employees who are eligible to participate in a newly proposed mentorship program.  Eligibility for this program was defined as people who were born in 1965.

## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
